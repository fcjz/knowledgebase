# knowledgebase
this is my knowledgebase,based on TiddlyWiki.
## The main purpose
For synchronizing and backing up my personal non-linear network notebook.
I will take the time to complete the configuration in the future. I remember that TiddlyWiki has the option of "GitHub save". As long as that configuration is done, synchronization is not difficult, just automatic saving and some other shortcomings... I can only solve it myself. 
Check out the Q&A on "What are the disadvantages of TiddlyWiki" on Zhihu.
